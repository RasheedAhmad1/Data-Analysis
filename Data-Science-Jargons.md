## Data Anaylytics
Depending on the stage of the workflow and the requirement of data analysis, there are four main kinds of analytics – *descriptive* analytics, what has happened in a business, *diagnostic* analytics, *predictive* analytics, what could happen and *prescriptive* analytics, what should happen.

It's a common misconception that data analysis and data analytics are the same thing. The generally accepted distinction is: Data analytics is the broad field of using data and tools to make business decisions. Data analysis, a subset of data analytics, refers to specific actions.[By bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/data-analytics-vs-data-analysis/#:~:text=It's%20a%20common%20misconception%20that,analytics%2C%20refers%20to%20specific%20actions.)

## Data Anaylysis
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)
OR
Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis

## Types of Data Analysis
Analysis of data is a vital part of running a successful business. When data is used effectively, it leads to better understanding of a business’s previous performance and better decision-making for its future activities. There are many ways that data can be utilized, at all levels of a company’s operations.

There are four types of data analysis that are in use across all industries. While we separate these into categories, they are all linked together and build upon each other. As you begin moving from the simplest type of analytics to more complex, the degree of difficulty and resources required increases. At the same time, the level of added insight and value also increases.

## Descriptive Analysis
The first type of data analysis is descriptive analysis. It is at the foundation of all data insight. It is the simplest and most common use of data in business today. Descriptive analysis answers the “what happened” by summarizing past data, usually in the form of dashboards.

The biggest use of descriptive analysis in business is to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs describe how a business is performing based on chosen benchmarks.

Business applications of descriptive analysis include:
* KPI dashboards
* Monthly revenue reports
* Sales leads overview

## Diagnostic Analysis
After asking the main question of “what happened”, the next step is to dive deeper and ask why did it happen? This is where diagnostic analysis comes in.

Diagnostic analysis takes the insights found from descriptive analytics and drills down to find the causes of those outcomes. Organizations make use of this type of analytics as it creates more connections between data and identifies patterns of behavior.

A critical aspect of diagnostic analysis is creating detailed information. When new problems arise, it is possible you have already collected certain data pertaining to the issue. By already having the data at your disposal, it ends having to repeat work and makes all problems interconnected.

Business applications of diagnostic analysis include:
* A freight company investigating the cause of slow shipments in a certain region
* A SaaS company drilling down to determine which marketing activities increased trials

## Predictive Analysis
Predictive analysis attempts to answer the question “what is likely to happen”. This type of analytics utilizes previous data to make predictions about future outcomes.

This type of analysis is another step up from the descriptive and diagnostic analyses. Predictive analysis uses the data we have summarized to make logical predictions of the outcomes of events. This analysis relies on statistical modeling, which requires added technology and manpower to forecast. It is also important to understand that forecasting is only an estimate; the accuracy of predictions relies on quality and detailed data.

While descriptive and diagnostic analysis are common practices in business, predictive analysis is where many organizations begin show signs of difficulty. Some companies do not have the manpower to implement predictive analysis in every place they desire. Others are not yet willing to invest in analysis teams across every department or not prepared to educate current teams.

Business applications of predictive analysis include:
* Risk Assessment
* Sales Forecasting
* Using customer segmentation to determine which leads have the best chance of converting
* Predictive analytics in customer success teams

## Prescriptive Analysis
The final type of data analysis is the most sought after, but few organizations are truly equipped to perform it. Prescriptive analysis is the frontier of data analysis, combining the insight from all previous analyses to determine the course of action to take in a current problem or decision.

Prescriptive analysis utilizes state of the art technology and data practices. It is a huge organizational commitment and companies must be sure that they are ready and willing to put forth the effort and resources.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a perfect example of prescriptive analytics. AI systems consume a large amount of data to continuously learn and use this information to make informed decisions. Well-designed AI systems are capable of communicating these decisions and even putting those decisions into action. Business processes can be performed and optimized daily without a human doing anything with artificial intelligence.

Currently, most of the big data-driven companies (Apple, Facebook, Netflix, etc.) are utilizing prescriptive analytics and AI to improve decision making. For other organizations, the jump to predictive and prescriptive analytics can be insurmountable. As technology continues to improve and more professionals are educated in data, we will see more companies entering the data-driven realm.

## Conclusion
As we have shown, each of these types of data analysis are connected and rely on each other to a certain degree. They each serve a different purpose and provide varying insights. Moving from descriptive analysis towards predictive and prescriptive analysis requires much more technical ability, but also unlocks more insight for your organization.

## Data Analyst
A data analyst’s fundamental job is to tell compelling stories with data that empower organizational leaders to make better, more informed decisions.
The responsibilities of a data analyst often include: 

* Designing and maintaining data systems and databases, including troubleshooting potential issues 
* Mining and cleaning data in preparation for analysis 
* Preparing reports which effectively communicate their findings to organizational leadership and key stakeholders 

To be effective in their roles, data analysts must possess the technical skills necessary for data mining, hygiene, and analysis, along with strong interpersonal skills to communicate their findings to decision-makers. 

Some of the most essential skills for data analysts include data visualization and presentation skills, Microsoft Excel, Structured Query Language (SQL), and R or Python programming knowledge. 

A bachelor’s degree in a related field is typically required for entry-level data analysts. For senior positions, hiring managers often require or strongly prefer a graduate degree such as a master’s degree in analytics. 

## Business Analyst
Business analysts are responsible for using data to inform strategic business decisions.

A business analyst might also hold job titles such as operations research analyst, management analyst, or business data analyst.

The duties of a business analyst typically include:

* Evaluating business processes for efficiency, cost, and other valuable metrics 
* Communicating insights with business teams and key stakeholders 
* Preparing strategic recommendations for process adjustments, procedures, and performance improvements

Some of the primary skills needed to become a successful business analyst include critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and process improvement. These professionals must have a firm understanding of their organization’s objectives and procedures so that they can analyze performance, identify inefficiencies, and propose and implement solutions.

Business analysts must have at least a working knowledge of the technology involved in analytics, though the need for hard technical skills is generally lower than for data analysts. For those looking for career advancement opportunities, however, developing an advanced knowledge of mathematics, computer science, and analytics can act as a significant differentiator in the job market.

Entry-level business analyst positions usually require a bachelor’s degree in business administration or related area of study. As the need for professionals with expert data skills increases, though, advanced degrees like a master’s in analytics or a master’s in business analytics are becoming more popular among job applicants. 

## Financial Analyst
A financial analyst is responsible for gathering and organizing financial information, analyzing it, and then creating presentations and recommendations to be shared with the management of a company or clients.

## Data Enigneer
Data Engineers are the data professionals who prepare the “big data” infrastructure to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are software engineers who design, build, integrate data from various resources, and manage big data. Then, they write complex queries on that, make sure it is easily accessible, works smoothly, and their goal is optimizing the performance of their company’s big data ecosystem.
The main difference between a financial analyst vs data analyst is that the former only works with accounting and financial figures, while the latter works with a wide range of numbers from different industries.

## Data Wrangling
Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)
OR
Data wrangling is the process of gathering, selecting, and transforming data to answer an analytical question. Also known as data cleaning or “munging”, legend has it that this wrangling costs analytics professionals as much as 80% of their time, leaving only 20% for exploration and modeling.

The *data mining* process is classified in two stages: *Data preparation/data preprocessing* and *data mining*. The data preparation process includes **data cleaning**, **data integration**, **data selection**, and **data transformation**. The second phase includes **data mining**, **pattern evaluation**, and **knowledge representation**. [By dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/data-mining-process-cross-industry-standard-proces)
## Data Parsing
Data parsing is a method where one string of data gets converted into a different type of data. So let's say you receive your data in raw HTML, a parser will take the said HTML and transform it into a more readable data format that can be easily read and understood
